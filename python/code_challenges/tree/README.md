## Binary Search Tree and BST Implementation

*Author: Kevin Henry with Anthony W and Tony R*

## Features

### Node
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

### Binary Tree
- Create a Binary Tree class
    - Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
        - pre order
        - in order
        - post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
    - Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capture-able errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.

### Binary Search Tree
    - Create a Binary Search Tree class
        - This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
        - Add
            - Arguments: value
            - Return: nothing
            - Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
        - Contains
            - Argument: value
            - Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

### Structure and Testing

- [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty tree
- [x] Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
- [x] Can successfully add a left child and right child to a single root node
- [x] Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
- [x] Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
- [x] Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal
