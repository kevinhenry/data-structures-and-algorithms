# Code Challenge: Class 37: Graph Business Trip

## Implementation: Graph
*Author: Kevin Henry with Anthony Williams and Tony Regalado

---
Given a business trip itinerary, and an Alaska Airlines route map, is the trip possible with direct flights? If so, how much will the total trip cost be?

## Feature Tasks:

Write a function called business trip
Arguments: graph, array of city names
Return: cost or null
Determine whether the trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.


## Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
