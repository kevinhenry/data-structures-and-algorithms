### Problem Domain

***[Problem Domain for the Code Challenge]***

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
- Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

  - Define a method called `insert` which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the `head` of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
  - Define a method called `includes` which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
  - Define a method called `toString` (or `__str__` in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
  - `"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"`

Class 06:

Extend a Linked List to allow varous insertion methods/

- Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

- `.append(value)` which adds a new node with the given `value` to the end of the list
- `.insertBefore(value, newVal)` which add a new node with the given `newValue` immediately - before the first `value` node
- `.insertAfter(value, newVal)` which add a new node with the given `newValue` immediately after the first `value` node
